      <h2>Why Playing Video Games is Good for Your Brain</h2>
      <p>From action-packed shooter games to challenging strategy games, we love a good video game. As technology advances and game developers keep creating fresh content, there seems to be a new game to try every day. Luckily for gamers like us, there are many benefits to playing video games that will encourage you to keep playing — as if you needed another reason.</p>
      <p>The positive effects of video games are numerous, from better memory and problem-solving to improved mood and social skills. While those who don’t play video games may argue that they make you lazy, harm your brain or ruin your social life, video games actually have many physical, cognitive and social benefits. The next time someone tells you that you play too many video games, you can turn to this list of 10 reasons video games are good for your brain:</p>

      <h3>1. Memory</h3>
      <p>Many video games require some serious strategy and concentration. If you have ever built your own civilization in Minecraft or fought for your life in Fortnite, you know how important it is to remember where you found specific resources or where you need to go next. With 3D graphics and immersive audio, video game environments are extremely rich in stimuli. Navigating the virtual world of video games is now very similar to navigating the real world. In fact, exploring video game universes can have a positive impact on memory in your everyday life. When you must juggle multiple tasks and goals while navigating a virtual space, you are exercising your hippocampus. This is the part of the brain responsible for converting short-term memory to long-term memory, as well as controlling spatial memory. When you keep your hippocampus in shape, you will see improved long-term memory and be better at navigating physical space. If you are prone to getting lost on your way to the store, video games may be able to help improve your memory for directions. A 2015 study from the University of California, Irvine provided evidence for the cognitive benefits of playing video games when they tested a group of gamers and a group of non-gamers in memory tasks. Those who frequently played complex 3D video games performed better at memory tasks related to the hippocampus than those who did not play video games or those who played only simple 2D games. The study also showed that when non-gamers played a complex 3D game each day for 30 minutes, their memory improved over time. As a person ages, their memory naturally declines. Regular video game play may be a great way to keep your mind sharp even as you get older, so you will always be able to find your car in the parking lot or remember how to get to your friend’s house.</p>

      <h3>2. Spatial Visualization</h3>
      <p>On top of improving your spatial memory, playing video games also helps you visualize space better. A 2013 study from the American Psychological Association showed that shooter video games improve how you think about objects in three dimensions. Gamers are better at judging distances between objects or mentally rotating objects to imagine how they might fit into a space. This enhanced spatial visualization has practical benefits, like knowing whether you will be able to parallel park in a tight spot or organizing your closet, so everything fits. Good spatial visualization is also essential for success in many STEM careers.</p>

      <h3>3. Perception and Vision</h3>
      <p>When faced with a complex environment with competing stimuli, your brain creates a perceptual template that helps you determine what is important and what is not. This perceptual template enables you to assess and respond to a situation. According to a 2014 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, playing action video games can improve a person’s ability to create perceptual templates. This type of improvement in perception is especially beneficial, as it is not task-specific but can apply to any situation. High-action video games can also improve your ability to distinguish patterns and different shades of gray. Scientists used to believe your ability to distinguish contrast was not something that could improve, however, research from the University of Rochester showed gamers who played about 5.5 hours of action games each week for nine weeks showed a 43 percent improvement in their contrast sensitivity. The gamer’s brains were able to process visual stimuli more efficiently, and this improvement in perception lasted for months after the experiment ended. This improved perception has valuable real-life benefits, such as being able to keep track of your friends better in a crowd or find something you have dropped in the grass.<p>

      <h3>4. Decision Making</h3>
      <p>Fast-paced video games like Need For Speed or Call of Duty require you to stay on your toes and make decisions quickly. These energizing action games can also improve your ability to make game-time decisions in real life. A 2010 study from the University of Rochester showed gamers who love action games could make accurate choices more quickly than non-gamers or those who play slow-paced video games. Their study tested participants in both visual and audio decision-making tasks. While all groups performed at about the same accuracy, the action gamer group completed the tasks up to 25 percent faster. Faster decision-making is beneficial in everyday life, as you can accomplish more when you make trivial decisions quickly. Instead of wasting time debating what shirt to wear, you can get real work done. Making decisions quickly can also have more serious implications. Just like being faced with an ambush in a shooter game, quick decisions are important when facing a dangerous situation in real life, such as a car that might hit you on the highway. Video games can also improve decision-making as it relates to long-term planning. When playing strategy games like Civilization or SimCity, you have to plan ahead and make decisions now that will benefit you down the road. These games train your brain to recognize potential outcomes and implications of your choices to make the best choices for your desired result. When a person practices these skills in a virtual world, they will be able to better apply them in the real world.</p>

      <h3>5. Problem Solving</h3>
      <p>Strategic and role-playing video games also challenge players to solve complex problems. This virtual problem-solving serves as great practice for real-life hurdles. The American Psychological Association showed in a 2013 study that adolescents who played strategy video games had improved problem-solving abilities and better grades in school. The study showed a correlation between how frequently the participants were playing games and how much improvement they saw — the more strategy games they played, the more their problem-solving skills and school grades improved. Almost every genre of video game involves problem-solving, whether it’s figuring out a puzzle or finding the fastest escape route. These problems can involve both memorization and analysis to solve them, as well as a little creativity. Obstacles in video games are often very open-ended without a lot of instruction, meaning players must experiment with trial and error. When your attempt to solve a problem in a video game fails the first time — or the first 10 times — you are also learning how to be resilient and persistent when facing challenges in real life.</p>

      <h3>6. Mood</h3>
      <p>Video games can also be a great way to relax and unwind. A 2013 study by the American Psychological Association showed that short and simple games, like Angry Birds, can improve a person’s mood and make them happier. Video games that are complex and deeply immersive can also be therapeutic. When the player is fully absorbed in a digital world, they do not have time to worry about work or bills. Video games can be a perfect way to give your brain a break from the anxiety and stress of everyday life.</p>

      <h3>7. Social Skills</h3>
      <p>The social benefits of video games have been widely debated, as some people argue video games lead to poor social skills or isolation. However, while excessive video game play may have negative social impacts, moderate video game play can improve social skills and reduce anxiety. When players are able to take on fictional personas in a virtual world, they are free to experiment with social interactions, which then teaches them what good social behavior is. Those who experience anxiety in social situations may feel more comfortable practicing social interactions in video games, without the real-life consequences. They can then be more confident when interacting with others in the real world. Video games also provide a thriving social setting for gamers. More than 70 percent of people who play video games play with a friend. Plus, the video game community is massive, and with modern technology, gamers can play with millions of other people worldwide at any time. Participating in virtual worlds with other players encourages communication and cooperation that carries over to real-life interactions.</p>

      <h3>8. Physical Fitness</h3>
      <p>While this positive effect of video games is not technically about your brain, it is still a significant benefit to mention. With the emergence of many fitness video games, it is easy to get a workout while playing an exciting video game. Games like WiiFit or Dance Dance Revolution require the player to get up and get active. These video games are good for your health and can be a great way to break a sweat without having to head to the gym. The most powerful benefit of these exercise-focused video games may be that they can change the way a person thinks about being active. These fitness games make exercising fun and provide an easy way to get in shape.</p>

      <h3>9. Youthfulness</h3>
      <p>As your brain ages, your memory, focus and ability to multitask all begin to decline. While young people are often able to juggle several different mental demands at once, older people may find it difficult to stay focused even on a single task. However, there are many ways to keep your brain young, such as by doing puzzles, eating healthy, exercising and even playing video games. In a study by the University of California, San Francisco, researchers created a simple driving game where players had to identify road signs while driving around obstacles. When required to multi-task, players of all ages performed worse than when only completing one task. However, those between 60 and 80 years old showed a drop in performance of 64 percent, while younger participants between 20 and 30 years old showed only a 26 percent performance drop. As the older players continued to train with the game, however, they experienced improved multi-tasking abilities, short-term memory and long-term focus. The benefits of playing the video game were so extreme that the older trained players performed better than untrained players in their 20s. Playing video games that require multi-tasking and focus may be a great way to keep your brain young.</p>

      <h3>10. Curiosity and Learning</h3>
      <p>On a basic level, when you are playing video games, your brain is working and growing. As you figure out how a game works and complete puzzles to master a level, you are creating new connections in your mind. The more motivated you are to beat the game, the more your brain is working and the more you are learning. Continued learning and stimulating your brain is essential to keeping it healthy as you age. Many video games are also set in different eras or historical settings, such as Assassin’s Creed and Grand Theft Auto. When playing these games, you are not only having fun, but you’re also learning about history. When a player enjoys the story or setting of these games, they may be motivated to continue learning more about it on their own.</p>
